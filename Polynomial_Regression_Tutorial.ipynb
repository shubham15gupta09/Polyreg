Some people used to say that there was the use of polynomial regression in the  mid $18 th$ century but it was widely unknown to everyone. This Polynominal Regression models generally fit using the least square. The least square method is a standard approach in regression analaysis to approximate the solution of overdetermined systems by minimizng the sum of the squares of the residuals made in the results of every single equation and The data fitiing is the most essential application. In $1805$ the least squares method was published by the reknowned Mathematician Legendrea and agian this least square theorem was also proposed by the mathematician Guass but the first desgin of an experiment for polynominal regression appeared in a paper named *Gergonne*.\n",
